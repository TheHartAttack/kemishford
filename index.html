      <div class="container about">
        <p>Kemishford Painters &amp; Decorators are a company that offers a friendly and professional service, dealing with all aspects of interior and exterior painting and decorating. The emphasis of our service is in paying attention to detail, and we place a great importance on understanding and interpreting our client's requirements with communication being the absolute key to this objective. This follows on through to the work we do and how we do it. Flooring, furniture, bathroom suites, kitchen units and anything else not being painted is covered over with protective polythene and/or dust sheets. Preparation is the key to a successful job - surfaces are always properly prepared or rubbed down to ensure a good key for the new paint and a smooth finish. We will always follow the paint manufacturers recommended application systems to ensure the best possible finish.</p>

        <p>We are more than happy to advise clients on appropriate and suitable products to meet the required application. This is by no means the limit of our remit, an almost unspoken rule, but probably the most important element of our business is that we are respectful, polite and sympathetic to the daily routine of our clients. We are acutely aware that we are trusted guests, and will maintain a clean and tidy environment whenever possible.</p>

      <h2>What our customers say...</h2>

      <div class="testamonials-inner">

        <div class="quote"><p>Steve is as courteous as he skilled and we knew who we would choose to do the work as soon as we met him and then received a detailed, clearly set out estimate - even though it was a little higher than other quotes. You get what you pay for and the standard of the work as well as tidiness and ongoing courtesy was excellent. This attitude of excellence is also passed down to Steve's team. Nothing was too much trouble including working around other tradesman running late to schedule. We would have no hesitation whatsoever in recommending Kemishford Interiors based on our experience.</p></div>

        <div class="quote"><p>I have been exceptionally pleased with the quality of the workmanship and overall professionalism. Mr Hart is a genuine businessman who performs his trade to highest skills and with only his client's interests in mind. Very good value work carried out to quoted price and without delays.</p></div>

        <div class="quote"><p>Everything about the work was first class - particularly the timekeeping and of course the quality of the finish and the level of care and cleanliness.</p></div>

        <div class="quote"><p>It's not the first time we have used Kemishford for redecorating. Steve is an absolute pleasure to work with. The job was completed quickly and with little impact on our family. Everything was left looking like it was brand new and immaculate. Perfect as always.</p></div>

        <div class="quote"><p>Outstanding attention to detail at all stages. Very thorough preparation. Delighted with the results of all three jobs. Will be using Kemishford Interiors again. Very tidy throughout, no time wasted and helpful with suggestions to achieve what we wanted.</p></div>

        <div class="quote"><p>We have used Kemishford for decorating at our home several times and will use again and again when work is needed. They are totally professional, work cleanly and are completely reliable. The workmanship is superb!!!</p></div>
